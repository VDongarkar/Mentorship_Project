      "The solution is usually setting up your Application Default Credentials (ADC).  There are a few ways to do this:\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:** If you're using a service account, you can download a JSON key file for the service account and then set the environment variable to the path of this file.  For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/keyfile.json\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/keyfile.json` with the actual path to your key file.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Using a service account in code:** If you're running your code in an environment where you can't easily set environment variables, you can explicitly load the service account credentials in your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose the method that best suits your environment.  Once you've set up your ADC, your code should be able to authenticate to Google Cloud services.  If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.\n",
